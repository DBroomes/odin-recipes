    If you love McDonald's Filet-o-Fish Sandwich as much as we do, you have to try this copycat recipe that rivals any
    drive-thru version. As one taster from our test kitchen, Liz Mervosh put it, "It's more than a copycat. It's better;
    more fish, more cheese, more sauce. The contrast between the crispy breaded fish and the steamed bun is A+. Skip
    McDonald's and make your sandwich."

    A thick, fish filet is fried (and according to our test kitchen, gets even crispier than the McDonald's version) and
    then stacked on a steamed bun with that signature tartar sauce. Here's how to make it.


    Ingredients
    canola oil, for frying

    4 (4-ounce) skinless cod fillets (about 4- x 4-inch large and 1-inch thick)

    1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided

    1 large egg

    1 tablespoon mayonnaise

    1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

    1 tablespoon corn starch

    1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

    1/4 teaspoon paprika

    2 cups panko (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)

    4 brioche hamburger buns, split

    4 (1/2-ounce each) processed American cheese slices

    2 teaspoons tap water

    McDonald's Tartar Sauce

    cooked shoestring fries, for serving




    Directions

    Step 1
    Gather all ingredients. Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven; heat oil over medium-high to 360
    degrees F (182 degrees C). Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Set a wire rack inside a large rimmed
    baking sheet; set aside.

    Step 2
    While oil heats, pat fillets dry with paper towels, and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Whisk
    together egg, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, corn starch, flour, paprika, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium
    shallow bowl until combined. Place panko in another shallow bowl. Working with one fillet at a time, dip into egg
    mixture, flipping to coat all sides and letting excess drip off. Place in bowl with panko, and coat all sides. Place
    on a large plate; repeat with remaining fillets.


    Step 3
    Gently add 2 fillets to hot oil; fry, gently stirring and flipping fillets in oil occasionally, until golden brown
    and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove fillets from oil using a slotted spoon, and place on prepared wire rack. Place in
    preheated oven to keep warm while repeating frying process with remaining 2 fillets.

    Step 4
    Working with 2 buns at a time, place bottom buns on a large microwavable plate; top each bun with 1 cheese slice.
    Lightly sprinkle a small paper towel with water, and place in small microwavable bowl with bottom buns. Cover plate
    with an inverted microwavable glass bowl. Microwave on HIGH until buns are steamy and cheese is melted, 15 to 20
    seconds. Carefully remove buns from plate; place top buns on the same plate and microwave on HIGH for 10 to 15
    seconds.

    Step 5
    Immediately top bottom buns with a fish fillet and drizzle 2 tablespoons McDonaldâ€™s Tartar Sauce on top. Cover with
    top buns and serve immediately with shoestring fries. Repeat with remaining buns and fish fillets.
