    Yield:
    3 8x4-inch loaves



    Ingredients
    3 cups white sugar

    2 cups butter, softened

    6 large eggs

    4 cups all-purpose flour

    â…” cup milk



    Directions
    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease three 8x4-inch loaf pans, then line with parchment paper.

    Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Beat
    in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Beat in flour alternately with milk, mixing just until
    incorporated. Pour batter evenly into the prepared loaf pans.

    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 70
    minutes.

    Run a small knife around the edges of each pan. Allow cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert, peel
    off the parchment, and cool completely on wire racks.
